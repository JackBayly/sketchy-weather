# Sketchy Weather
<p>A weather app with a very professional-looking UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although, the mockup was meant to be a first draft, it made me laugh to have the UI look like a kindergardener did it, i.e. sketchy. So I went for it. Most of the images in the final version come from my first mockup pictured below.</p>
<p>Here's a live demo: -coming soon-</p>
<h2>Things Learned/Practiced</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using APIs (e.g. <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> and the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Gify Api</a>)</li>
  <li>Manipulating data from APIs</li>
  <li>Creating my own images (however simply)</li>
  <li>CSS Grid and Flexbox</li>
  <li>Mobile first design</li>
  <li>Button functionality/event listeners</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Honestly, it's perfect XD. But really, I had a lot of fun making this project. I'd like to build on it in the future. The main goal of the app was to practice using APIs. It was hard to figure out how to use data from an API, but once I got the hang of it, they turned out to be easier to use than I thought (although I'm sure as I continue my coding journey I'll use more complex APIs.) I also liked the process of designing for mobile first. It felt easier than desiging desktop first.       </p>
