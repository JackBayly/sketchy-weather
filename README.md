# sketchy-weather
<p>A weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It started off as a joke when I made the mockup below as a first draft of what the app was going to look like. Although it was meant to be a first draft it made me laugh to have the UI look like a kindergardener did it.</p>
<p>Here's a live demo: https://jackbayly.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/ </p>
<h2>Things Learned/Practiced</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using APIs (e.g. <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> and the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Gify Api</a>)</li>
  <li>Manipulating data from APIs</li>
  <li>Creating my own images (however simply)</li>
  <li>CSS Grid and Flexbox</li>
  <li>Mobile first design</li>
  <li>Button functionality/event listeners</li>
  
  </ul>
<h2>Things to Improve</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the user enters 7 or 11 for the grid square numbers, the grid comes out distorted.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the clear button will make the grid green.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>I like how this project turned out. The idea is simple and it's fun to play with. The hardest part of this was getting the grids to change colors on a "swipe" on mobile. I looked at a lot of sources to get the touch events to work. Probably learning about mobile touch events was the most difficult part of this, as they didn't work as I expected. The DOM manipulation to create the grid in a container was also challenging. I loved how it turned out though. It was interesting to see how a for loop could be used to create the grids. While there are two bugs I found while finishing up, they're minor and with some time I can fix them. Overall, pretty proud of how it came out. </p>
